\section{Interaction techniques}
The purpose of our experiment is to test different interaction techniques against each other.
Before designing and implementing the experiment we must find a suitable number of techniques to test. 
We decided on four interaction techniques and in this section we describe them and explain why these four techniques were chosen.

Our four techniques all make use of some combination of air pointing and touch gestures on the smartphone screen.
By using the Kinect's depth camera it is possible to facilitate air pointing and when it is combined with a smartphone's touch sensors, it would be possible to design an almost infinite amount of interaction techniques.
However, we found each technique in papers where they were used in applications or systems to interact between phones and displays. 
According to \cite{} it is also advised to use already existing techniques opposed to making new techniques.

The techniques are \swipe, \tilt, \throw, and \pinch.
The \swipe technique is used by Bragdon et al. \cite{Bragdon:2011} in Code Space, a system supporting developer meetings. 
Bragdon et al. describes the technique as: \emph{``cross-device interaction with touch and air pointing''} and the swipe motion is described as \emph{``flicking up on the touch screen''}. \\
 
\swipe and \tilt are one-handed techniques, meaning they are supposed to be performed with only one hand, opposed to \throw and \pinch which are techniques that require both hands.

The \swipe technique is performed by 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\arabic*\upshape)]
	\item{pointing at a target on the large display with the phone in stretched arm, and}
	\item{making a forwards swipe motion on the phone.}
\end{enumerate*}

The \tilt technique is performed by 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\arabic*\upshape)]
	\item{pointing at a target on the large display with the phone in stretched arm, and}
	\item{making a forwards tilt with the phone.}
\end{enumerate*}

The \throw technique is performed by 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\arabic*\upshape)]
	\item{pointing at a target on the large display with one hand} 
	\item{holding the phone in the other hand, and}
	\item{making a swinging motion towards the large display.}
\end{enumerate*}

The \pinch technique is performed by 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\arabic*\upshape)]
	\item{holding the phone in one hand} 
	\item{making a pinch gesture on the phone with the other hand, subsequently closing the hand}
	\item{pointing at a target on the large display with the closed hand, and}
	\item{opening the hand to complete the technique.}
\end{enumerate*}
