\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Concluding Remarks}

The work we did this semester ended with two scientific papers as products. \\\\
The two papers give us an increased understanding of working and developing applications for cross-device interactions with regards to large public displays and mobile devices.
We learned about the challenges of creating successful, efficient and accurate cross-device interaction techniques that feel natural for the users to perform, in a way that they are capable of walking up to the display and performing the technique with as little guidance as possible. \\\\
We did this by developing four techniques and developing an experiment around them where we analyze the hit rate, time per target and distance from target for each of these techniques.
We also measured the naturalness of each technique by listening to users comment throughout our experiment, as well as asking them to fill out a small ease of use questionnaire for each technique. \\\\
These two papers have built a foundation for our work next semester, were we might use the strong techniques to develop a working applications or further explore the techniques we have developed in different contexts or different measures of success.
