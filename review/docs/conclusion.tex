\section{Conclusion}\label{Sec:Conclusion}
In this paper we presented an overview of HCI research within interacting with large displays. We reviewed 34 papers from the last decade in detail. A picture was drawn about the relation of different areas, a sub-set within large displays was discovered in public displays. Based on the further examination of the different areas of research, we identify some opportunities and shortcomings that we used to suggest possible future research areas.\\
\\

In the future we would like to see quantitative research within the field of cross-device natural user interaction, as well as use of the produced statistically solid results as a guide for the design of further applications for cross-device interactions.\\
