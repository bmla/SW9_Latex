This report documents the development of a smartphone application that utilizes virtual reality to replicate a physical game experience.
For this project it was decided to use Jenga as a case study.

The project evaluates several smartphone components in order to determine which are usable for virtual reality.
Of the sensor components evaluated it was found that the gyroscope, accelerometer and compass were suitable, while the suitable feedback components were found to be the display, speakers and vibrator.

The application was developed to obtain a virtual reality representation of the Jenga game experience.
It allows the player to rotate the in-game camera in three dimensions in the virtual environment.
