\section{Conclusion}

We conducted a study on cross-device interaction techniques, where our focus was on pushing data from a mobile device onto a large display.
We compared four different techniques (\pinch, \swipe, \throw and \tilt) with two different target sizes.
Our main concern was investigating the success rate, efficiency, accuracy and ease of use of the user while using the different interaction techniques.

Our findings show that \swipe was the technique with the highest success rate, and at the same time, the most efficient and accurate technique.
This was also the technique the users felt easiest to use.
We also found that \pinch was considered to be a fun and entertaining technique by many of our users.
Finally, we also found that the mapping between the screen and the users pointing direction is critical to the applications success. 
Great care should be taken to achieve as close to an absolute mapping as possible.
