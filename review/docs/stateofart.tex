\section{State of the art of interacting with large displays}
We present an overview of research in interaction techniques for cross device interaction, with an emphasis on the natural user interface.\\
By looking at Public Space we found the following topics in HCI: Cross-device Interaction, Large Displays, Multi-device Interaction, Natural User Interface, Proxemics, Social Interaction, Tabletop Interaction, and Tangible Interaction. \\
We used these topics for our inquiry in ACM DigitalLibrary, SpringerLink and Microsoft Research, which matched a total of 56 papers. \\
To narrow down our focus we selected papers that matched a set of strict criteria: (1) The paper should contain one or more interaction techniques, (2) It is important that the techniques are evaluated using either interviews, surveys, field studies or any other research method.\\
The final set contained 34 literature sources which we further examined, by writing a short summary for each paper which included ``title, author's thesis (aim of paper), objectives (goals, summaries), methodologies used, findings, conclusion, and keywords''. 
Using applied thematic analysis different themes were induced on the summaries, which we later categorized into 5 themes: interaction with large displays, interaction with public displays, natural user interactions, cross-device interactions, cross-device natural user interactions.\\
The identified themes and the specific papers correlated to them are presented in \Cref{tab:themes}, with full citations in the references section of this paper.
