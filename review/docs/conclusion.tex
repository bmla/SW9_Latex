\section{Conclusion}\label{Sec:Conclusion}
In this paper we presented an overview of HCI research within interacting with large displays. We reviewed 34 papers from the last decade in detail. A picture (\Cref{fig:litreview}) was drawn about the relation of large displays, public displays, cross-device interaction and natural user interaction. Cross-device interaction and natural user interaction was found to be a subset of large- and public displays. Based on further examination of these areas in research, we identified cross-device natural user interaction as well as some opportunities and shortcomings that we used to suggest possible future research areas.\\
In the future we would like to see quantitative research within the field of cross-device natural user interaction, as well as use of the produced statistically solid results as a guide for the design of further applications for cross-device interactions and large displays.
