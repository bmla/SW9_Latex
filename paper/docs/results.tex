\section{Results}
We will now present the results that we achieved through out our experiment and also how they were achieved. We will first present our findings in respect to success rate, then in respect to efficiency, and finally in respect to accuracy. We will show that there is a significant interaction between our two independent variables, grid size and technique, with regards to success rate. Finally, we will look at the questionnaires and show the significant findings there. We will discuss these results later, in the \nameref{sec:discussion} section.  

\subsection{Success Rate}
In this section we will present the results related to the success of hitting a target.
We will perform an analysis of the success rate and the effect of each technique with respect to grid sizes.

The success rate's mean and standard deviation for each technique for small and large grid size can be seen in \Cref{tab:meanHitTechniqueSmall} and \Cref{tab:meanHitTechniqueLarge} respectively.

	\textbf{Large Grid Success Rate}\\[4pt]
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			\rowcolor[HTML]{9B9B9B}

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Mean hit  and standard deviation for each technique per target for large grid.}
	\label{tab:meanHitTechniqueLarge}
\end{table}

In order to see the effect of each technique on the hit ratio per target for small grid, we performed a one way, repeated measure ANOVA ($F(2.645,2420.246)=105.535$, $p<0.001$), which told us that the different techniques had a significant effect on the hit ratio. 
We perform another pair-wise post hoc LSD test to see where the significant differences are. \pinch and \tilt had $p=0.094$, which means that there was no significant difference between these two techniques. All other techniques were significantly different from each other ($p<0.001$). 

\subsection{Efficiency}
In this section we present the efficiency results which defines the amount of time spent performing a technique.
We perform an analysis of the efficiency and the effect of each technique with respect to grid sizes.

The four interaction techniques, \pinch, \swipe, \throw and \tilt were completed 18 times per participant. 
For each grid size, each technique was performed 477 times. 
\Cref{tab:meanTimesTechniqueSmall} and \Cref{tab:meanTimesTechniqueLarge} shows the mean time per target for each of the techniques as well as their standard deviation for both grid sizes.

		Mean & 9.23  sec         & 6.41 sec          & 7.73 sec          & 6.67 sec         \\ \hline
		Std. Dev. & 6.48 sec & 4.49 sec & 6.6 sec & 4.49 sec \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Mean time and standard deviation for each technique per target for small grid.}
	\label{tab:meanTimesTechniqueSmall}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\textbf{Large Grid Efficiency}\\[4pt]
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\rowcolor[HTML]{9B9B9B} 
		 & \textbf{Pinch} & \textbf{Swipe} & \textbf{Throw} & \textbf{Tilt} \\
		 \rowcolor[HTML]{9B9B9B}
		 & (n = 477) & (n = 477) & (n = 477) & (n = 477) \\ \hline
		Mean & 8.09  sec         & 5.01 sec          & 6.42 sec          & 5.33 sec         \\ \hline
		Std. Dev. & 6.6 sec & 2.66 sec & 5.43 sec & 3.04 sec \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Mean time and standard deviation for each technique per target for large grid.}
	\label{tab:meanTimesTechniqueLarge}
\end{table}

A one way, repeated measure ANOVA revealed, with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction (0.874), that the difference in time per target between the different techniques is in fact a significant($F(2.622, 2498.37)=67.192$, $p<0.001$). A post hoc pair-wise test using a LSD correction revealed that \pinch and \swipe($p<0.001$), \pinch and \tilt ($p<0.001$), \pinch and \throw ($p<0.001$), \swipe and \throw ($p<0.001$), and \throw and \tilt ($p<0.001$) were all significantly different from each other. However, \swipe and \tilt were not ($p=0.092$)

We then examined the effect of grid size on time. Each participant had a equal mixture of small and large grid targets. This means that the four techniques had 9 targets of each size; four large and four small. Every test had 36 targets of each size, totaling 1908 targets of each size, through out all tests. \Cref{tab:meanTimesSize} shows the mean time per target and standard deviation for each grid size. 

To determine the effect of grid size on target hit time, we applied another one way, repeated measures ANOVA($F(1,1907) = 77.587$, $p<0.001$). This means that the grid size has a significant effect on time when hitting the target. 

\subsection{Accuracy}
Finally, we will perform an analysis of the accuracy and the effect of each technique with respect to grid sizes.
