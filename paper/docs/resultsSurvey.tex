\subsection{Results of Survey Easy of Use}
Our questionnaire was based on USE, which used Likert scale \ref*{sec:expdesign}, when encoding the data we did it as continuous variable, as such \emph{"strongly disagree"} got a value of 1, and \emph{"strongly agree"} a value ot 7. After that the cumulative value per technique, based on the different questions, was calculated, the data was ploted and presented in \ref{fig:surveyResult}.

One way MANOVA \todo{I am not sure if we should use 1 way MANOVA for this test, while the results make sence I think we should ask Dimitrious} was applied after ($F(3, 49)=2.8387$ is our decision rule, since the calculated F\textsubscript{emp}=4.970, $p<0.000$ we can reject H\textsubscript{0} hypothesis, there was a statistically significant difference between techniques. The post hoc revealed that in regards to: (1) It is easy to use there is no statistical difference between \throw \tilt \pinch; (2) Using it is effortless there is no statistical difference between \throw \tilt \pinch; (3) It is easy to learn to use there is no statistical difference between \tilt \throw; (4) I can use it successfully every time there is no statistical difference between \tilt \pinch; (5) I quickly became skillful with it there is no statistical difference between \pinch \tilt; (6) I learned how to use it quickly  there is no statistical difference between \throw \tilt \pinch.
