The evolution of ways people interact with the digital has been momentous and notable in the short life-span of technology. Not only has the perception of device use, and device choice, but also the context we use devices has been under transformation multiple times. From portable personal computers, originally considered mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountancy, or for sales representatives, which addressed mobility of a person's workspace, to modern hand-held devices which presented, their users, such degree of freedom that ultimately workspaces are starting to deteriorate. This expansion has not only increased mobile computing, but also made it widespread. \\

As divergent technologies and devices are being adopted in different domains cross-device interaction is currently becoming more important and relevant, on account of people bring their hand-held devices with them everywhere. This means that going out is not only a person taking a walk, but also a hand-held device. This ubiquitous presence of devices means that it can be leverage to enhance ordinary situations. E.g. by providing a mediator, now when you go to the cinema early, you don't have to just sit you can play a game on the screen with the present people inside.\\
