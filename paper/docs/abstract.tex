In this paper we aim to find a compare techniques that allows a user to intuitively walk up and use a large display. The selected techniques are \swipe, \tilt, \pinch, and \throw, they are characterized by allowing the users to interact with large screen in a natural way, using one or both hands, with different levels of complexity and time. The choice of techniques was enabled from explored literature based ot preset criteria.

We report on two, laboratory and usability, studies conducted on the aforementioned techniques. The data collected and later analyzed, from said studies, was presented in three clusters \emph{Target Hit Time}, \emph{Accuracy} and\emph{ Results of Survey Easy of Use}.

Finally discussed the relation between the presented data in conceptual aspect concluding that some techniques have a potential in general context (\swipe), while others more in entertainment-wise context (\pinch).
