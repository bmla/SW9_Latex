\begin{abstract}
In recent years, the number of papers regarding cross-device interaction techniques has increased.
However, there is still no definitive answer to the appropriate techniques for data transfer between mobile devices and large displays.

In this paper, we illustrate four different cross-device interaction techniques used for pushing data from a mobile device onto a large screen.
We develop a prototype system that allows us to measure efficiency, accuracy and user satisfaction with these four techniques.
Our findings point at certain techniques (\swipe, \throw) being more efficient compared to the other two.
Our data also suggests that one of the techniques (\pinch) might be better suited under a more entertainment oriented context.

\todo[inline]{Another suggested abstract, which one do you think is best}

In this paper we aim to find a compare techniques that allows
a user to intuitively walk up and use a large display. The
selected techniques are Swipe, Tilt, Pinch, and Throw, they
are characterized by allowing the users to interact with large
screen in a natural way, using one or both hands, with different
levels of complexity and time. The choice of techniques was
enabled from explored literature based ot preset criteria.

We report on two, laboratory and usability, studies conducted
on the aforementioned techniques. The data collected and later
analyzed, from said studies, was presented in three clusters
Target Hit Time, Accuracy and Results of Survey Easy of Use.

Finally discussed the relation between the presented data in
conceptual aspect concluding that some techniques have a
potential in general context (Swipe), while others more in
entertainment-wise context (Pinch).
