In this paper we present a state of the art discussing the literature from two emerging and relatively new areas of the HCI field, namely cross-device interaction and natural user interaction. 
Papers from these two areas are reviewed and categorized into 5 themes: Interacting with large displays, Interacting with public displays, Natural user interactions, Cross-device interactions, and Public space and cross-device natural user interactions. We present an overview of each theme and analytically outline them, furthermore we discuss their connection presenting their overlapping areas.  Our finding indicate a concentration of research in natural user interaction, and cross-device interaction, but limited work in cross-device natural user interaction, suggesting a gap in HCI knowledge worth investigating.
