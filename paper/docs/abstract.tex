\begin{abstract}
In this paper we aim to find a compare techniques that allows a user to intuitively walk up and use a large display in the context of transferring data between it and hand-held device. The selected techniques, with different levels of complexity and time. The choice of techniques was enabled from explored literature based ot preset criteria.

We report on quantitative study with to elements,laboratory use and ease of use, conducted on the aforementioned techniques. The data collected and later analyzed, from said studies, was presented in three clusters \emph{Target Hit Time}, \emph{Accuracy} and\emph{ Results of Survey Easy of Use}.

Finally discussed the relation between the presented data in conceptual aspect concluding that some techniques have a potential in general context (\swipe), while others more in entertainment-wise context (\pinch).
