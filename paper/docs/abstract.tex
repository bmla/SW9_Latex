\begin{abstract}
In recent years, the number of papers regarding cross-device interaction techniques has increased.
However, there is still no definitive answer to the appropriate techniques for data transfer between mobile devices and large displays.

In this paper, we illustrate four different cross-device interaction techniques used for pushing data from a mobile device onto a large screen.
We develop a prototype system that allows us to measure efficiency, accuracy and user satisfaction with these four techniques.
Our findings point at certain techniques (\swipe, \throw) being more efficient compared to the other two.
Our data also suggests that one of the techniques (\pinch) might be better suited under a more entertainment oriented context.

\todo[inline]{Another suggested abstract, which one do you think is best, please give feedback}

In this paper we aim to find a compare techniques that allows a user to intuitively walk up and use a large display in the context of transferring data between it and a hand-held device. 
The techniques were chosen from explored literature based on preset criteria which include different levels of complexity and time.

We report on a quantitative study by examining the techniques with respect to accuracy and time but also how people feel when using them by looking at the ease of use. The data collected and later analyzed, from said study, was presented in three clusters \emph{Target Hit Time}, \emph{Accuracy} and\emph{ Results of Survey Easy of Use}.

Finally we discussed the relation between the presented data in conceptual aspect concluding that some techniques have a potential in general context (\swipe), while others more in entertainment-wise context (\pinch).
