Tilt:
	- Shared some accidental recognitions
Pinch:
	- Few start issues with undestanding the technique
	- After that, and the technique was understood, 
	  everything looked good
Swipe:
	- No questions about the technique
	- No problems
	- Was paying more attention to the video this time 
	  then previously
Throw:
	- The video is not clear about the motion 
	  (the fact that you have to do a bigger gesture)
