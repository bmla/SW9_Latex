        abstract = {We present a survey and taxonomy of gesture-based computer interactions motivated by a literature review of over 40 years of gesture based interactions. This work presents a unique perspective on gesture-based interactions, categorized in terms of four key elements: gesture styles, the application domains they are applied to, input technologies and output technologies used for implementation. The taxonomy provides a means of addressing gestures as an interaction mode across the different application domains so that researchers and designers can draw on the vast amount of research that has been addressed within the literature from an interaction perspective.}
