\section{Conclusion}

We conducted a study on cross-device interaction techniques, where our focus was on pushing data from a mobile device onto a large display.
We developed four different techniques (\swipe, \tilt, \throw and \pinch) and two different target sizes and compared them to each other.
Our main concern was investigating the speed, precision and satisfaction of the user while utilizing the different techniques, as well as investigating the effect of the different grid sizes on speed and precision.  

Our findings show that \swipe was both the most efficient technique out of the other four.
This was also the technique the users felt most positive towards.
We also show that \pinch has potential in a more entertainment-wise context, where a gradual mastery over the technique is a wanted attribute, but more research is called for in order to properly determine this.
We also discover that the need for precision comes at a great cost of the efficiency.
Efficiency is greatly decreased the smaller the target is. 
Finally, we also uncovered that the mapping between the screen and the users intended pointing direction is critical to the applications success. 
Great care should be taken to achieve as close to a one-to-one mapping as possible.
