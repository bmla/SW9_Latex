The first paper is a literature review over the current state of the art in regards cross-device natural user interaction for mobile devices and large displays. In this work we analytically summarized relevant research outlining the current field and potentially identifying knowledge gaps. 

The second paper presents a research experiment regarding four different cross-device natural user interaction techniques. Here we explore the techniques based on success rate, efficiency, accuracy and ease of use. We then present our result and discuss their implications.
