In \textit{Scroll, Tilt or Move It}, Boring et al. (2009) \todo{Create reference} investigated cross device interaction between large displays and mobile phones. More specifically, he investigated three different interaction techniques in order to continuously control a pointer on a large screen from a mobile device. \textit{Move} and \textit{Tilt}, two of the three interaction techniques, enabled faster selection time compared to the last one, \textit{Scroll}, but at the cost of higher error rates. They showed that different interaction techniques have certain strengths and weaknesses, and depending on the context and use, certain techniques can be used rather other.
