\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}
This collection of papers is the result of our 9th semester work, as software engineers, in Human Computer Interaction, at the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University.\\\\
The theme of our project is cross-device interaction between mobile devices and large displays. Here we present two papers. First a literature review, then a research paper. \\\\
A CD containing the source code of the developed systems is supplied together with this report. The CD also contains a digital copy of this report as well as appendices with e.g. interview transcriptions. Additionally, it contains all logged numbers used for the quantitative analysis, enclosed as database exports. \\\\
We would like to thank Jeni Paay, Associate Professor at Aalborg University, for providing ongoing feedback and guidance throughout the project
