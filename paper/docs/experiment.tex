\section{Experiment}
The four cross device interaction techniques mentioned above where implemented and then evaluated in a lab study in order to judge their performance compared to each other.

\subsection{Participants}
In total, 53 people took part in our experiment, which was conducted at Aalborg University's usability lab. The participants where between 20-45 years old (M: 24.4, SD: 4.3) and were between 1.63 and 1.95 meters tall (M: 182, SD:7.8). 88.7\% of users where right handed, and 96.2\% of them where smart phone users. Users had owned smart phones for 2-15 years (M:5, SD:2.1). The participants had several different backgrounds, but a very large part of them where university students. This was not formally recorded. They were recruited through a mixture of our social network, recruitment posters around the campus, and going through group rooms and asking for participants.
